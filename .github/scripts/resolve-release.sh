#
# Resolve a tool's GitHub release and verify every artifact the tap is about to
# reference. The default is the latest release; callers may pin a tag when
# reproducing an already committed formula or cask.
#
# THIS IS THE ONLY COPY OF THE VERIFICATION RULES. It used to be hand-written
# once per tool, which meant a new tool could silently ship without the URL pin
# (the check that stops a release from redirecting a formula's download
# somewhere the tag does not name). Adding a tool now means adding a manifest,
# and the manifest cannot opt out of any of this.
#
# Every artifact must:
#   1. match exactly one asset on the release by name — not "at least one", so
#      a decoy asset with a colliding name is a hard failure, not a coin flip;
#   2. have a browser_download_url byte-equal to the canonical
#      https://github.com/<repo>/releases/download/<tag>/<name> — GitHub is
#      free to hand back a different host, and the formula must not follow it;
#   3. hash to 64 lowercase hex after download.
#
# Manifests may additionally demand the digest agree with what the release
# itself published, either per-asset (`sidecar: true` → <name>.sha256) or via
# one combined manifest (`sums: "SHA256SUMS"`). Those files are fetched through
# the same three checks — a checksum you fetched from an unpinned URL proves
# nothing.
#
# Usage: resolve-release.sh <manifest.json> <work-dir> [tag]
#
# Writes:      <work-dir>/release.json      the raw release payload
#              <work-dir>/dist/<asset>      each downloaded artifact
#              <work-dir>/dist/<asset>.sha256   "<digest>  <asset>"
#              <work-dir>/env               KEY=value lines
# Stdout:      the same KEY=value lines, for `eval` in a local dry run.
#
# Emitted keys: TAG, VERSION, RELEASE_JSON, DIST, and per present asset
# <KEY>_NAME and <KEY>_SHA256. An absent optional asset emits neither, so a
# renderer tests presence with `${FOO_SHA256:-}`.

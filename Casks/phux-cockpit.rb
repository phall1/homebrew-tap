  caveats <<~EOS
    Phux Cockpit runs the installed phux TUI in its Workspace pane and an
    ephemeral local shell beside it. Workspace state is managed by phux;
    Local Shell history is not restored when the app restarts.

    This release is ad-hoc signed and not Apple-notarized. The cask clears
    its quarantine attribute so macOS can launch it without a Developer ID
    certificate.
